METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
<Include links or references to publications or other documentation containing experimental design or protocols used in data collection>

2. Methods for processing the data: 

Submitted data represents the mean (and SD) of the raw data generated over the experiment for each response variable contained in the dataset, and 
environmental scenario see below, point 5). 

3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: not applicable

4. Standards and calibration information, if appropriate: Not applicable

5. Environmental/experimental conditions: 
Freshwater plankton communities were exposed to three environmental scenarios using the Limnotrons existing at the Netherlands Institute of Ecology. 
The environmental scenarios tested were: (1) Present (Ambient temperature and pCO2), (2) Future (Ambient temperature + 3ºC and pCO2, 1000 ppmv), 
and (3) Future+Phoslock (Ambient temperature + 3ºC and pCO2, 1000 ppmv; plus Phoslock addition).

6. Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data:
